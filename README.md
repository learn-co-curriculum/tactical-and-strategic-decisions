## Instructions

Identify an organization that is a client for your data science project. In an organization that you are familiar with (it can be where you work or a new organization that you want to learn about), identify two decisions—one tactical, the other strategic—where data science is or can be used to significant effect.  Specify at a high level the data and the organizational requirements of applying data science in both of those settings. What’s an important roadblock to success?  (Hint: it may help you to decide on a criterion or working definition for ‘tactical’ versus ‘strategic’ decisions.)

Be prepared to share and discuss your thoughts in class.
